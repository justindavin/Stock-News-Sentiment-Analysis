       "{'AAPL': [' Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 13 line hits the market Friday, and it’s bringing impressive changes to the smartphones’ cameras, batteries, and performance. The lineup includes the pint-size iPhone 13 mini, the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Pro, and the hand-stretching iPhone 13 Pro Max. As with the iPhone 12 lineup, pricing for the iPhone 13 family runs from $699 for the entry-level mini to $1,099 for the entry-level iPhone 13 Pro Max. But this time around you’ll get more storage out of the mini and base iPhone 13. That’s because instead of just 64GB, each iPhone now comes with a minimum of 128GB of space. After using the latest iPhones for a few days, I think it’s clear they’re worthwhile upgrades for anyone who’s rolling with anything other than an iPhone 12. If you do have a 12, then upgrading to the iPhone 13 isn’t a must — but you’ll still find welcome changes that may be worth your hard-earned cash. These changes include: Slick new camera features Faster processors Dramatically longer battery life You’d be forgiven if you had trouble telling the difference between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. They’re all essentially the same size, and they all still have the same notch cutout at the top of their displays. Camera placement for the 13 mini and 13 is also slightly different. Both the iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 also have the same screens as their immediate predecessors, with the mini getting a 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR display, and the iPhone 13 getting a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display. The 6.1-inch iPhone 13 Pro and the 6.7-inch Pro Max, however, get very welcome upgrades in the form of Apple’s ProMotion display technology. The feature allows the Pro and Pro Max’s Super Retina XDR displays to automatically adjust their refresh rates from as low as 10Hz, or 10 frames per second, to as high as 120Hz depending on what you’re viewing. The result is an iPhone that feels far smoother while navigating between apps, scrolling through websites, and playing games. It’s quite a noticeable difference from the iPhone',\n",
       "  ' A California district judge struck a blow to one of Apple’s (AAPL) major revenue engines on Friday by ruling that the iPhone maker needs to give app developers the ability to offer alternative app payment options to consumers. Apple currently restricts developers to using its own Apple payment service, which automatically draws a 30% commission from the sale of apps. Developers including Spotify (SPOT) have complained of the commission for years, but the ruling by District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rodgers means app developers will soon be able to offer their own in-app payment options to consumers. If consumers chose to buy apps outside of the App Store, it would cut Apple out of the equation. That means it would no longer be able to collect that 30% commission on app sales, or a lower 15% commission it collects on companies that make less than $1 million a year. “The ruling is a major black eye for Apple and changes the economics of the store for the company,” Patrick Moorhead, president Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance. “It’s a major win for companies that don’t want to be forced to use its payment mechanisms. Freedom prevailed today.” Despite the ruling, though, Wall Street’s reaction was relatively muted. Apple’s stock price fell just more than 2% following the announcement. And some analysts say any losses won’t hurt Apple in the long run. For its part, Apple focused on the fact that the judge found it did not have a monopoly in the market for mobile games. \"Today the court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,\" Apple said in a statement. \"As the court recognized ‘success is not illegal.’ We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace that supports a thriving developer community and more than 2.1 million U.S. jobs, and where the rules apply equally to everyone.\" According to Sensor Tower, consumers spent $72.3 billion on apps in the App Store in 2020. During his testimony, Epic’s expert witness Ned Barnes said that',\n",

       "  \"The two men, detained more than one thousand days in China, currently on a flight to Canada, says Prime Minister Trudeau  Starbucks' (SBUX) famous Pumpkin Spice Latte has not only helped boost the coffee chain's foot traffic, but also social media conversations about the classic fall flavor.\\xa0 Social media analytics company Sprout Social compiled data on volume, keywords and conversation trends between August 1 and September 21. The firm found that pumpkin is still the most talked about fall flavor — despite the fact that Starbucks recently debuted its new Apple Crisp Macchiato this year.\\xa0 Online conversations favored the chain's Pumpkin Spice Latte compared to the new addition by a large margin (40.53K to 17.58K, respectively). Pumpkin conversations have also tracked significantly more volume than apple conversations – 146K compared to 24K, the company said.\\xa0 For Starbucks, the Pumpkin Spice Latte has consistently been a strong driver for growth. The signature drink debuted in 2003, with more than 500 million sold to date. The social media data further highlighted consumers' obsession with fall— with search trends related to seasonal flavors, like pumpkin spice or apple crisp, jumping toward the end of the summer.\\xa0 According to Sprout Social, total conversation volume spiked 4,265% with 9.5K conversations on August 24 (the date Starbucks rolled out its fall flavors) compared to the day prior.\\xa0 That momentum continued into the first week of September, with volume surging a whopping 347% versus the last week of August — well before fall's official start on September 22.\\xa0 Overall, sentiment surrounding the return of fall and those classic autumnal flavors came in largely positive at 43%. This was followed by 35% neutral and 21% negative. With consumers ready and eager to embrace the change of season, companies have been quick to incorporate new fall items. Brands embracing pumpkin-flavored products this year include Pepperidge Farm (CPB), Dairy Queen (BRK-B), Tim Hortons (QSR) and Samuel Adams (SAM).

       "  \"People's Bank of China vows to stop all companies from facilitating cryptocurrency trading Apple fans queued outside the technology giant’s Regent Street store in central London to be among the first to get hold of the iPhone 13 as the new smartphone range went on sale in the UK. Unveiled last week, the four new iPhone 13 handsets all have improved battery life and cameras. A modest queue began to form outside the store at 7.30am on Friday, with Apple staff applauding the first customers inside when it opened its doors at 8am. The pandemic and increased options for buying online and reserving pick-up times have seen physical queues outside Apple Stores scaled back in recent years. Unveiling the iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max during a virtual event last week, Apple boss Tim Cook said they are the “best iPhones we have ever created”. As well as the battery and camera improvements, Apple has reduced the size of the notch at the top of the screen and introduced a 120Hz refresh rate, which means smoother screen scrolling, on the two Pro models. Prices for the new iPhone range start from £679 for the mini, up to £1,549 for the top-of-the-line Pro Max, which has one terabyte of storage – the largest Apple has ever offered on an iPhone. The improvement in battery life is likely to appeal to many smartphone users, experts have said, with Uswitch.com mobiles expert Ru Bhikha arguing that is “at the top of people’s wish-list for the new handset”.

It has four variations — the iPhone 13 mini, the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Pro, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max. The new phones will retail from £679 in the UK and $699 in the US. The iPhone Pro Max – with one terabyte of storage – will be the most expensive iPhone ever, retailing at £1,549 in the UK and $1,099 in the US. They vary in size but are not hugely different from the iPhone 12 in terms of looks. One difference is that the notch at the top has been shrunk by 20%, meaning the screen is bigger. The orientation of the rear cameras is also different on some of the new models. Users that might be looking for better camera specs will notice the new phones gather 47% more light and now includes night mode.

       "  'New jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week  Written by Andrew Button at The Motley Fool Canada Warren Buffett is an investing legend for a reason. Averaging 20% annual returns over an astounding 55-year period, his results speak for themselves. If you’d invested $10,000 with Warren Buffett at the start of his run, you’d be a millionaire by now. That fact is made all the more impressive by the observation that Buffett doesn’t generally invest in ultra-small caps. For the most part, his superior track record was achieved by investing in average, everyday stocks that most people already know about. With that in mind, here are three well-known Warren Buffett stocks that I would buy and hold at today’s prices. Suncor Energy (TSX:SU)(NYSE:SU) is a stock that Warren Buffett has owned on and off over the years. Most recently, he bought it in 2020. Suncor Energy’s earnings were devastated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent oil prices to stunning lows. At one point, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures went negative. As a result, Suncor’s earnings were negative for every single 2020 quarter. But in 2021, oil prices started rising again. Driven by the economic recovery, demand began to climb. As a result, Suncor Energy managed to crank out positive earnings and strong growth in cash flow in its most recent quarter. If this trend continues, the company may be able to raise its dividend, which it had to cut because of the pandemic. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Warren Buffett’s single largest stock holding. It’s also the biggest company in the world by market cap. Apple has a number of qualities that render it a good value: A strong brand High revenue per customer Diversification into new businesses (e.g., Apple Music) with a built-in customer base that’s ready to buy. AAPL is by most definitions a great stock. It has decent growth, high profit margins, and relatively sane earnings multiples. The stock is not as cheap as those that Buffett has traditionally bought, but it makes up for it in growth and profitability. Personally, I would buy this stock. Bank',\n",
       "  'Empire State Manufacturing Index unexpectedly surges in September as orders, shipments picked up  Investors are nibbling at Apple (AAPL) ahead of a potentially big September.

Apple\\'s stock is the second-best performing member of the FAANG [Facebook (FB), Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google (GOOG, GOOGL)] cohort in the last month, only lagging an eye-popping 17% rip higher in Netflix.\\xa0 The tech beast is now leading rival Microsoft in the ongoing race of most valuable company — Apple\\'s market cap is currently $2.6 trillion compared to $2.3 trillion for Microsoft. The bid under Apple\\'s stock probably reflects several factors.\\xa0 First, Apple got the bulls excited on Tuesday by sending out a save-the-date reminder via email for a Sept. 14 event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters titled: \"California Streaming.\" The invite will likely spur speculation on a barrage of new streaming content for Apple that takes direct aim at Amazon and Netflix. But, Apple could also surprise everyone with a new piece of streaming-centric hardware (much lower probability, however).\\xa0 Meantime, while the invite today suggests a large focus on streaming Apple is widely expected to unveil its latest suite of iPhones. Apple analysts on Wall Street are very bullish on what could be the iPhone 13, but also strong continuing demand for the 5G capable iPhone 12 series.\\xa0 [Read more: Apple to launch new iPhone 13 at Sept. 14 event] \"We continue to see Apple shares set up for multiple catalysts into the back end of this year, including not only the upcoming iPhone 13 launch, but also low investor expectations for iPhone and total revenue for FY22, led by concerns relative to cycling past the peak upgrade cycle associated with 5G,\" pointed out JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a recent research note.\\xa0 Chatterjee raised his 2022 sales volume estimates for Apple,'],\n",
       " 'TSLA': [\"August's jobs data falling far short of market expectations last week has tempered hopes for Q4  Coming back from the Labor Day weekend, Tesla (TSLA) shares marked a 2.64% gain on Tuesday, trading at just over $750 by market close. And while some experts are targeting $3,000 per share, TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan explains why TD’s clients are selling Tesla in the near term. “[TD Ameritrade’s clients] sold [Tesla shares] in July and August, which I think is very interesting overall,” Kinahan told Yahoo Finance Live. “[They sold for] a couple of reasons. Number one, because when Tesla gets back above $700, it seems to bring people out as sellers a little bit more.” Indeed, the $700 mark has demonstrated itself to be a key support for the EV manufacturer’s shares, with Tesla last dipping below $700 in mid-August. Kinahan described the $700 level as being a “magnet on the stock.” The second reason, Kinahan believes, has more to do with the growing competition Tesla is facing in the EV space. Though it has not all been smooth sailing for emerging players such as GM (GM), with its recent recall expansion to cover all Chevy Bolt model years over a battery fire risk, the prospect of EV rivals getting hot on the heels of Tesla may be spurring TD Ameritrade’s clients toward buying into the competition. “The competition has heated up so significantly over the last year,” Kinahan added. “You see Ford (F) and GM as two stocks that our clients were actually buying as they sell Tesla.” Ford and GM shares are up this year approximately 48% and 18%, respectively, while Tesla lags behind at around 7%. While Ford and GM have demonstrated their ability to move units, Kinahan said, the OEMs have yet to prove their worth in the EV space compared to Tesla. For now, he cited Tesla’s superior battery technology and manufacturing capabilities as giving the company a leg up. “Tesla, obviously, has better battery technology that gives them an advantage over others,” Kinahan said. “But I think what our clients are\",\n",
       "  'Renewed signs of an escalating crypto crackdown in China sent major digital tokens tumbling  TURIN (Reuters) -Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk said on Friday that thanks to new semiconductor plants that are planned or under construction, the global chip shortage that has pummelled the car industry this year should be short term in nature. Asked how long he thought the global chip shortage would affect vehicle production, Musk said: \"short term I think\". \"There\\'s a lot of chip fabrication plants that are being built,\" Musk said during a joint session with Stellantis and Ferrari Chairman John Elkann, at Italian Tech Week. \"I think we will have good capacity for providing chips by next year,\" he added. The two automotive industry leaders agreed on potential support coming from nuclear power to cover for increasing global energy needs. \"I am surprised by a recent move away of some countries form nuclear energy, which is safe,\" Musk said. But in their dialogue they avoided referring to competition issues between top electric mobility leaders such as Tesla and legacy automakers now investing heavily to expand their offer of electrified vehicles. Musk however thanked Elkann for a support Tesla received between 2017 and 2019 from Comau, the robot unit of Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, during what he called \"one of the most painful periods\" for his company, linked to the launch of production on Model 3. \"John helped me a lot in that period,\" Musk said, adding Tesla had come close to bankruptcy \"half a dozen times\".

       "  'With the stock market pulling back sharply over the last few trading sessions, investors would probably expect a high beta technology stock like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to be down significantly as well. That’s surprisingly not the case, as the electric vehicle company has been showing serious relative strength amidst market weakness. This could be a sign that Tesla is gearing up for an end-of-year rally, particularly when you consider the fact that the stock has been stuck in neutral for the majority of 2021. Although Tesla’s current valuation might raise some eyebrows among investors who are keen on fundamental analysis, the company’s unique brand and market-leading status in the EV industry still make it one of the most intriguing companies today. According to MarketBeat, there are even analysts out there bold enough to slap a $1200 price target on the stock, which implies the potential for massive upside. The truth is that Tesla might be one of the best stocks to consider buying in the S&P 500 at this time, and here are a few reasons why:  Sometimes, it pays to keep things simple when it comes to investing. We know how many governments and businesses are focusing on clean energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels, and this trend is only going to gain momentum in the coming years. For example, consider the Biden Administration’s $7.5 billion plan to expand electric vehicle charging to underserved areas. That’s a huge reason why Tesla could deliver strong outperformance over the long term, as it’s a company that is disrupting both the automotive and power generation industries with cutting-edge clean energy technology. The global EV market is expected to reach an estimated $725 billion by 2026 and international markets like China and Europe are seeing huge demand for these vehicles. Tesla is well-positioned to expand internationally into these high-growth markets thanks to a gigafactory in Shanghai and a planned gigafactory in Berlin. Tesla is also investing heavily in R&D to reduce its manufacturing costs and improve its technology, which could at some point allow for the mass adoption of electric',\n",

After setting a new all-time high upon the S&P500 inclusion, the stock lost an incredible 40%. However, the recent price action has been very encouraging for bulls. As the stock marches to new highs, we will look at the current ownership structure in this article. See our latest analysis for Tesla. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, explained the move to sell 180,000 TSLA shares as a cash-raising measure to boost the stake in UiPath (NYSE: PATH). Wood pointed out that TSLA remains the largest holding in her portfolio, confirming the bullish stance on the stock. Meanwhile, the company just obtained a patent for laser beam windshield wiper technology. From the current standpoint, it is hard to understand why anyone would potentially point a laser toward the driver. Still, a proper application of this technology is yet to be understood. In addition, Tesla also possesses a patent for electromagnetic wipers. The problems with automated driving are persistent as the latest Model 3 fatal crash in Florida prompted the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agency officials have been following the application of autonomous driving technologies, already investigating 33 crashes involving Tesla vehicles with partially automated driver-assist systems. On a more positive note, Wedbush Securities issued a positive note, claiming that Tesla can get to 900k deliveries in 2021 and 1.3m in 2022. The data below shows that after the first half of 2021, the company still leads the global plug-in EV market. Wedbush has Tesla as “Outperform,” with a price target of US$1,000, which would be a new all-time high. With a market capitalization of US$752b, Tesla is relatively large.

The San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) also disputed the name of the system, \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD) saying it is an advanced driver assistance program, not an autonomous vehicle system. Tilly Chang, Executive Director of the SFCTA, said in a statement to Reuters that a human driver should \"continuously monitor\" Tesla\\'s FSD system. \"We are concerned about the safety record of this service and the name of the service as it could be confusing for consumers, and hope DMV, FTC and NHTSA continue to monitor and analyze this issue to protect consumers and the traveling public,\" she said. The authority administers funding for transit and roadway projects in San Francisco. A number of Tesla crashes, now under federal investigation, have heightened regulatory scrutiny this year. On Monday, California\\'s state regulator said: \"Based on information Tesla has provided the DMV, the feature does not make the vehicle an autonomous vehicle per California regulations.\" The California Department of Motor Vehicles reiterated that it was \"reviewing the company’s use of the term \\'Full Self-Driving\\' for its technology.” Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Last week, Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla drivers would be able to request a “beta” version of its \"Full Self-Driving (FSD)\" software starting Friday. Those rated \"good drivers\" by Tesla\\'s insurance calculator would be able to use the system. Tesla sparked controversy by testing the unfinished technology to 2,000 people since October on public roads. Musk said there have been no accidents with the beta users. \"FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isn’t necessary, but it is. Also, any beta user who isn’t super careful will get booted,\" Musk tweeted. The beta offers features allowing vehicles',\n",

There is little doubt that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), the electric vehicle (EV) maker headquartered in California, has made giant strides in establishing itself as the biggest name in not only the EV space but also the automotive industry as a whole over the last decade. The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has a market capitalization of $720 billion. Since the IPO in 2010, the stock has surged more than 20,000%. However, it is also one of the most high volume names on the market, a stock characteristic that often leads to price volatility.  After registering a record rally that lasted through most of last year - Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock price jumped more than 700% between February 2020 and February 2021 - the stock has been taking a breather since April on the back of concerns around slowing EV demand, a global chip shortage that has affected EV production, and a dramatic fall in the price of cryptocurrencies. The company is heavily invested in the new technology and reportedly bought more than $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin earlier this year.  Despite these concerns, some of which have been around for years, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has continued to consistently beat the market on growth, smash earnings expectations on Wall Street, and provide investors with record returns. For example, in earnings results for the second quarter, posted on July 26, the company reported earnings per share of $1.45, beating market predictions by $0.47. The revenue over the period was close to $12 billion, up 98% year-on-year and beating analyst estimates by $560 million.  The delivery numbers of Tesla, Inc.

The Roku Streaming Stick 4K and Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ promise improved speeds and wireless performance when they hit the market later this October. The sticks are meant to goose hardware sales going into the holidays, as well as combat competing streaming offerings from the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). Roku’s stock has been hit with declines since it reported a miss on its Q2 player sales, posting $112.8 million in revenue compared to Wall Street expectations of $121.3 million. The $49 Streaming Stick 4K is the first of the company’s new products and promises a 30% performance boost thanks to a new quad-core processor, as well as 2X faster Wifi connectivity from a redesigned long-range wireless receiver. The Streaming Stick 4K is also now compatible with Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10+, the company’s previous streaming stick only supported HDR10. That should cover the major versions of HDR, meaning you’ll get great-looking colors on HDR-capable TVs. The Streaming Stick 4K includes a voice remote that allows you to tell the device to pull up channels and perform voice searches. What’s more, the Streaming Stick 4K is compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, which lets you control the stick with either third-party voice assistant. The stick is also compatible with Apple’s AirPlay 2, so you can stream from your iPhone or Mac to your big-screen. The $69 Streaming Stick 4K+, meanwhile, packs all of the features of the Streaming Stick 4K, but adds a remote that you can call out to when it’s lost in your couch cushions. To use it, you say “Hey, Roku. Find my remote,” and it will make a noise to help you track it down. The remote has private listening and hands-free modes, as well as a rechargeable battery.

       "  ' Amazon (AMZN) is facing expanded antitrust claims in an amended lawsuit originally brought against the e-commerce giant in May by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia. The original suit, filed in May, accused Amazon of illegally abusing its monopoly power and violating the District of Columbia Antitrust Act by forbidding third-party sellers from offering cheaper rates for their products on competing websites. In the amended suit, Washington, DC Attorney General Karl Racine adds claims that Amazon had anti-competitive agreements with wholesalers, otherwise known as “first-party sellers,” that sell products to Amazon for the company to resell to its retail consumers. “Amazon employs a different anti-competitive agreement with its first-party sellers to insulate it from competition from other online marketplaces,” the amended complaint states. “In their sales agreements, first-party sellers and Amazon agree that the first-party seller guarantees Amazon a certain minimum profit when Amazon sells the products it purchased from the first-party seller on Amazon’s online marketplace.\" In the contracts, called Minimum Margin Agreements, the attorney general alleges, first-party sellers must agree to a minimum profit for Amazon. In the event that Amazon sells the product for a price that falls short of that profit, the agreement dictates that first-party sellers have to pay Amazon the difference in an arrangement called a \"true-up,\" according to the amended complaint. As a result, Racine concludes, the sellers have an incentive to charge more for their products on non-Amazon marketplaces to ensure that Amazon doesn\\'t drop its price based on lower prices elsewhere.\\xa0 “These agreements reduce other online marketplaces’ ability to compete with Amazon by offering lower prices to consumers,” Racine said in a prepared statement. In the first complaint, the AG targeted Amazon’s rules for allegedly increasing the price of retail items across the entire online marketplace, ultimately harming both everyday consumers and third-party sellers. Amazon\\'s third-party seller agreement, up until at least 2019, the complaint alleged, included a clause that explicitly barred sellers from offering products on competing sites. The claims went on to say that Amazon \"suppressed competition from other online retail sales platforms, such as eBay,',\n",

China real estate developer Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, while the Chinese central bank injected cash into the banking system, to eradicate global market fears of contagion from the debt-laden property developer and its default risks. Evergrande fears shook the markets lately on a potential of the Lehman-like crisis. However, equity investors now seem to overlook uncertainty over monetary and fiscal policy and ongoing debates in Washington over the debt ceiling. Buy-the-dip strategy also helped boost equities. Cyclical sectors outperformed as the Federal Reserve stressed on the economic progress.

The average time for most stock investors to hold a stock is now about 5 ½ months, down from 18 months pre-pandemic. That means for most investors, the thought of owning a stock for 5 or 10 years is very foreign. And investors will get out at even a hint of non-performance. Amazon AMZN\\xa0soared in 2020 after the coronavirus sell-off, gaining 74% between Mar 9 and Nov 9. But in 2021, shares haven’t gone anywhere, adding only 3.4% for the year. How many investors have stayed in the stock this year? Are you considering selling because other stocks are performing better even though you consider yourself a long-term investor? 1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Don’t look at your portfolio every day. There’s no reason to see how much money you are making, or losing, every single day. This is short-term thinking. It will distract you from your long-term investing goals. 2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Buy some stocks that pay dividends. We all like getting “free” money. If you get a stock that stagnates for a year or more, getting a dividend can help smooth over some of the pain. For example,\\xa0Starbucks SBUX\\xa0stock went nowhere from 2016 to 2019.

       " 'NVDA': [' This article originally appeared on Simply Wall St News. NVIDIA Corporation ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) is in the enviable position of supplying components to some of the fastest growing industries in the world - including gaming, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, visualization, and cryptocurrency mining. With a market value of $538 billion, it is the 11th most valuable company listed on US markets, and on the verge of overtaking TSMC ( NYSE:TSM ) as the most valuable semiconductor manufacturer in the world. However, when a company is the size of Nvidia, it becomes more difficult to maintain the growth rates that got it to that size in the first place. Amongst the world’s mega-cap companies, Nvidia has one of the richest valuations, apart perhaps from Tesla  ( Nasdaq:TSLA ). Nvidia\\'s price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 74x is second only to Tesla amongst the 20 largest companies. And Nvidia’s price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 24x is the highest amongst this group of companies. These metrics suggest that Nvidia and Tesla have the most future growth priced into their valuations amongst mega cap stocks.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA  When we estimate Nvidia’s intrinsic value using analyst forecasts we arrive at a value of $107.75, implying the stock is overvalued by about 103%. This estimate is calculated using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity and you can see the full calculation here . Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Both of these can, and probably will change, over time - so the $107 value is just an estimate based on current forecasts. Clearly the market believes Nvidia can grow faster than current forecasts suggest. One of the reasons for this is the metaverse, and Nvidia’s efforts to accelerate growth in the industries it supplies. The metaverse is a virtual, 3D, digital world, or worlds. Currently, the metaverse is mostly confined to games like Fortnite and Minecraft. But in the future, the metaverse promises to be a place to work and play. It',\n",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 New Penny Stocks Redditors are Buying. Penny stocks have started gaining traction on popular Reddit forums in the past few months as retail investors, who are often willing to bet on growth domains like software, biotechnology, and space, become an important market force. In June, investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed that retail investors accounted for roughly 10% of daily trading volume on the Russell 3000 - the broadest US stock index. At the peak of retail investor interest in the market last year, these investors were responsible for 15% of the daily trading volume on the Russell 3000.  When viewed in context of a JPMorgan report earlier this year that a retail investor boom in the market was just beginning and that these investors were set to pour over $1 trillion into equities this year, the interest around penny stocks has exploded. Reddit forums, often the social media platform of choice for these retail investors, are full of discussions around the next big penny stocks. Some of these stocks are discussed in detail below. However, Reddit forums are also focused around more expensive growth offerings as well. Some of the stocks presently popular on Reddit include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), among others. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global markets strategist at JPMorgan, estimates that retail investors have already invested close to $500 billion into stocks this year. In a report, he highlighted the significance of the market transformation as a result of this.  According to Panigirtzoglou, a list of stocks popular with retail traders in the US had rebounded in May and had outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 since March 2020. The strategist also highlighted how a basket of stocks containing NASDAQ-listed and Russell 2000 firms had also outperformed the S&P 500 since mid-May, underscoring the market shift towards',\n",

You can skip our detailed analysis of these micro-cap stocks and go directly to 5 Best Micro-cap Stocks to Invest In. As the economy comes back to normal, investors are beginning to pay attention to small companies that are operating in high-growth sectors. Micro-cap stocks — companies with market caps between $50 million to $300 million — are on investors' radar as they offer promising returns as compared to big stocks that have already matured. The larger potential for benefit in micro-cap is often debated and has been studied heavily by researchers. Micro-cap companies in Canada, the United States, and other developed markets, according to Foerster et al, have relatively high returns and low correlations to large-cap stocks, offering diversification benefits in addition to outperformance. However, what leaves most investors baffled is the emergence of bubble stocks, that rise exponentially overnight due to popularity on social media forums. Investors often use popular forums like Reddit to discuss investment prospects. Reddit threads are filled with discussions regarding best micro-caps to invest in. Apart from this, they are also bursting with mentions of expensive firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: UBER), Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Ray Dalio. Billionaire Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates, one of the most successful hedge funds today with over $15 billion in assets under management, in 1973 when he was still learning the ropes on Wall Street. Over the years, Dalio, whose personal net worth is close to $20 billion, per news publication Forbes, has become one of the prominent names in the finance world through an investment strategy that carefully bets on both value and growth stocks. Between March and June this year, the portfolio value of the fund has jumped by $4 billion. The top ten holdings comprise 33% of the portfolio with investments concentrated in the consumer goods, technology, and services sectors. The fund, which is based in Connecticut, made new purchases in 329 stocks, bought additional stakes in 255, reduced holdings in 116 stocks, and sold out of 80 equities during the second quarter of 2021, according to the latest 13F filings. Even though he came from humble beginnings, starting out as a caddy, Dalio has a degree from Harvard Business School and has also worked at a commodities firm.  Some of the top growth stocks in the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the second quarter of 2021 were Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Coupa Software Incorporated (NASDAQ: COUP), among others discussed in detail below. The success of Dalio - since inception, the total returns of his hedge fund have crossed $46 billion in value - has been an exception in the finance world that has struggled to produce more icons like him.  The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market',\n",

During the second quarter of 2021, the Baron Opportunity Fund returned 10.14% (institutional shares).

You should check out Baron’s top 5 stock picks for investors to buy right now, which could be the biggest winners of 2021. In the Q2 2021 Investor Letter, the fund highlighted a few stocks and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of them. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing platform company. In the last three months, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained 43%. Here is what the fund said: \"NVIDIA Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing chips. Shares of NVIDIA rose in the second quarter on financial results and guidance significantly above Street expectations, as it benefited from the upgrade cycle in its gaming franchise along with continued AI-related strength driving its data center segment. NVIDIA’s total revenues of $5.66 billion beat Street expectations by $266 million, growing 84% (including the benefit of acquisitions, 65% organic), with its gaming business growing over 100% and its data center business expanding nearly 80%. We remain confident in NVIDIA’s leading position in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines.\" Earlier this month, we published an article revealing that Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of the 5 best semiconductor stocks to invest in right now. In Q1 2021, the number of bullish hedge fund positions on Nvidia Corp.

       "  ' On Sep 23, equities logged their best day since July, with the major indexes on their way to shake off their earlier weakness on Evergrande news. China real estate developer Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, while the Chinese central bank injected cash into the banking system, to eradicate global market fears of contagion from the debt-laden property developer and its default risks. Evergrande fears shook the markets lately on a potential of the Lehman-like crisis. However, equity investors now seem to overlook uncertainty over monetary and fiscal policy and ongoing debates in Washington over the debt ceiling. Buy-the-dip strategy also helped boost equities. Cyclical sectors outperformed as the Federal Reserve stressed on the economic progress. The Fed has also gave cues of an imminent QE taper. \"It’s not a surprise to me that the Fed is moving forward with the tapering,\" Jeff Schulze, ClearBridge chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"If you think about the three-month moving average ... we\\'re at about 740,000 jobs created per month. That is stronger than anything we\\'ve ever seen pre-COVID,” as quoted on Yahoo Finance (read: Fed Taper to Start in November? 7 ETFs to Buy). The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield touched 1.41% to reach its highest level since July on taper talks. Investors seemed okay with this rise in rates as growth stocks did not seem to have taken a hit on Sep 23. Economic progress probably has helped investors to keep patience and encouraged them to invest in the corporate strength. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few stocks of the S&P 500 that played to a crucial role in boosting the index on Sep 23. Amazon.com Inc.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices.

According to Andy Rachleff, the chief of automated investment firm Wealthfront, software tools have made it possible for even someone with $500 to open a brokerage account, something that previously required a fortune. In May, a study by private equity firm CB Insights found that funding in retail tech had reached more than $28 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2021, nearly tripling in value when compared to the first quarter of 2020. On August 19, Robinhood, one of the applications favored by retail investors for stock trades, revealed in an earnings report that it expected a retail investor spending frenzy to take a breather between June and September. It also claimed that retail trading in crypto had helped double the revenue for the firm.  Most retail investors use online platforms like Reddit to exchange stock ideas. Some of the top trending stocks on Reddit presently include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla, Inc.
